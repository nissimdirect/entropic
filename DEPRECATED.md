# DEPRECATED — Entropic v1

> **This codebase is deprecated.** Do not build new features here.

## What This Was
Entropic v1 — FastAPI + JavaScript web UI. 126 effects, 3,610 tests, shipped through v0.7.0-dev.

## What Replaced It
**Entropic v2 Challenger** at `~/Development/entropic-v2challenger/`
- Electron + React/TypeScript + Python sidecar
- Full documentation suite (29 docs, 14 phase blueprints)
- Decision locked 2026-02-18 via Gap Analysis Rev 5

## Why It's Still Here
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE-DEEP-DIVE.md` — referenced by v2 Challenger BUILD-BLUEPRINT.md
- `docs/RD-EFFECTS-RESEARCH-2026-02-18.md` — referenced by v2 Challenger BUILD-BLUEPRINT.md
- `docs/UAT-FINDINGS-2026-02-15.md` — referenced by v2 Challenger BUILD-BLUEPRINT.md
- Effect source code will be ported to v2 Challenger in Phase 1 and Phase 8

## Do Not
- Add new effects here
- Fix bugs here
- Write new docs here
- Use this as reference for architecture (use v2 Challenger ARCHITECTURE.md instead)
